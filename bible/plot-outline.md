# Plot Outline

## Act Structure
<!-- Define your structural framework.
     e.g., Three-act, five-act, hero's journey, kishōtenketsu, etc. -->


## Beat Sheet

<!-- The medium-agnostic story beats. Each beat is a story event
     independent of how it's rendered in any output format.

| # | Beat | Summary |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
-->


## Key Turning Points
<!-- Major story beats that must land:
     - Inciting incident:
     - First act break:
     - Midpoint reversal:
     - Second act break / dark night:
     - Climax:
     - Resolution:
-->


## Story-to-Output Mapping

<!-- Maps each story beat to its corresponding unit in each output format.
     This keeps all outputs synchronized around the same narrative.

| Beat | Novel Chapter | Conti Episode | Screenplay Scene |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Inciting incident | Ch 03 | Ep 02 | Scene 12 |
| First act break | Ch 07 | Ep 05 | Scene 28 |
| Midpoint reversal | | | |
| Climax | | | |
-->


## Open Threads
<!-- Plot points that have been set up but not yet resolved.
     Track these to ensure nothing is dropped.
     - Thread description — set up in beat #, to be resolved by beat #
-->


## Deviations Log
<!-- Where an output diverged from the beat sheet, and why.
     - [output] [unit]: [what changed] — [why]
     e.g., conti ep 04: split beat #5 across two episodes for pacing
